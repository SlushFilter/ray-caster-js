Raycaster in Javascript / HTML
This is a simple demo that I wrote when learning about 3d math.

Summary:
- This is the same rendering technique that was used in Id Software's Wolfenstein
- The algorithm is simple : Per vertical pixel column, check the distance to the closest thing on the blockmap and draw a column of pixels that approximates the distance.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code.
Cheers!
